## The purpose of project

The portfolio project is a project that is specifically designed to showcase my skills, abilities, and accomplishments to potential employers or clients. The purpose of a portfolio project is to demonstrate my expertise and proficiency in a particular area or field, and to provide evidence of your ability to complete complex tasks and projects.

A portfolio project can be used to highlight my skills in a specific domain, such as software development, graphic design, or data analysis. It can also be used to showcase your overall abilities as a problem solver and your ability to work on a team.
